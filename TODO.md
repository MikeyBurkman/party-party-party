- Set a color to use instead of transparent in the final image
- Manually set a transparent pixel color, or coordinates to use for transparent
- Figure out a better transparent pixel, instead of always picking green
- Glowing transformation (maybe selectable glow color?)
- Expand transformation (image expands and contracts)
- Use levenshtein distance to help with transform name typos
- Allow transforms to call other transforms first. (IE: party might call grayscale first)
- bang-head-into-wall effect?
- Cold effect (make image blue, add snow animation)
